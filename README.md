# Interpretable_ML_Resources

This repository is devoted to curating and organizing resources used to increase the ability of humans to understand and explain models. 

It prioritizes quality over quantity, and thus doesn't try to be exhaustive.  For exhaustive aggregations, see the resources at the bottom of this page.
